### **Abstract**

[cite_start]Safety and operational performance are directly impacted by efficient fluid level control in industrial tanks[cite: 11]. [cite_start]In order to overcome inherent process delays, this study examines how to improve liquid level regulation in linear tank systems by fusing conventional PID control with a Smith Predictor framework. [cite_start]We started by using the Ziegler-Nichols and Cohen-Coon approaches to determine the ideal PID parameters[cite: 13]. [cite_start]According to our research, the Smith Predictor mechanism significantly reduces key performance indicators such as overshoot percentage, settling time, and error indices (more especially, IAE and ISE values)[cite: 15]. [cite_start]When compared to traditional methods, this combination provides better system responsiveness and stability[cite: 16]. [cite_start]The outcomes demonstrate how well Smith Predictor mitigates the effects of time delays, making it a useful addition to PID control systems for industrial liquid level applications for management[cite: 17].

### **Key Findings & Conclusion**

[cite_start]This study demonstrates the significant benefits of using a Smith Predictor-enhanced PID controller for managing liquid levels in systems with time delays[cite: 323].

* **Improved Performance:** The combined approach achieved significant improvements, including decreased overshoot, faster response times, and better stability[cite: 324].
* [cite_start]**Superior Tuning:** When comparing tuning methods, the Cohen-Coon (C-C) method was found to be preferable for stability and efficiency in liquid level regulation[cite: 264]. [cite_start]The C-C method offers a quicker settling time with less overshoot compared to the Ziegler-Nichols (Z-N) method[cite: 262].
* **Effective Delay Compensation:** The results clearly show that the Smith Predictor effectively counteracts the negative effects of time delays, making it highly useful for industrial applications like chemical processing and water treatment[cite: 327, 328].
